    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At <strong>EdenForge</strong>, we believe that outdoor spaces should be more than just functional — they should be lasting works of art. As a landscape construction company, we specialize in transforming raw land into refined environments that offer both beauty and purpose. Whether it's a serene backyard retreat, a bold architectural feature, or a fully integrated outdoor living space, we bring your vision to life with precision and care.</p>
    <p>From meticulously laid stonework to thoughtfully curated garden designs, our work reflects a deep respect for nature, structure, and style. Every project we undertake is a balance of creativity and craftsmanship.</p>
    <p>We don’t just build landscapes — we forge enduring outdoor experiences. Our goal is to create spaces that not only flourish over time, but also elevate the lives of those who live in them. With EdenForge, you’re investing in an outdoor environment that is truly built to bloom, and designed to last.</p>
